  
Heap is a special tree-based data structure.
A binary tree is said to follow a heap data structure if
   1. it is a complete binary tree
   2. All nodes in the tree follow the property that they are greater than their children i.e. the largest element 
      is at the root and both its children and smaller than the root and so on. Such a heap is called a max-heap. 
      If instead all nodes are smaller than their children, it is called a min-heap
