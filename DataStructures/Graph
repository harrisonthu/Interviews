DFS vs BFS (see more on Youtube: DFS vs BFS (4-differences EASY EXPLANATION))

DFS--> Use "Stack" --> able to Backtrack
DFS --> Use 1 child pointer(connecting only 1 from each node)


BFS--> Use "Queue" ==> No Backtracking 
BFS --> Use 2 or more child pointers(connecting more than 1 to k childs from each node)
