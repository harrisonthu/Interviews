Example: 
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, 
replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process 
until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
