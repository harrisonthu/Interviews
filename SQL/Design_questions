How will you design your partitions for the hive table which stores active users? 
How does your design impact queries like determining monthly/ yearly active users). 
Here, you need to think from a product owner's perspective to figure out what are the criteria you would like to track to determine the success of the product (e.g. if it is an app, monthly install rate, monthly active users, uninstall rates etc.). Next, you will be asked to write SQL/ Python code to implement these metrics on your proposed design.
