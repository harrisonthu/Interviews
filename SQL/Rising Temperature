-------    outer query take care of temperature

SELECT w1.id        
FROM Weather w1                 ----- w1 ==> today date
WHERE w1.temperature >  -- comparing temperature
    (SELECT w2.temperature      ----- w2 = yesterday
    FROM Weather w2
    WHERE w2.recordDate = DATEADD(DAY, -1, w1.recordDate))  -- comparing recordDate
